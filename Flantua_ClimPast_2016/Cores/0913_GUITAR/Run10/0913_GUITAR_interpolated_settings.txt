Calibration curve: IntCal13.14C, postbomb_NH1.14C for postbomb dates
Age-depth model: linear interpolation between dated levels [type=1]
Weighted by the calibrated probabilities [wghts=1]
Calculations at 95% confidence ranges [prob=0.95]
Amount of iterations: 1000 [its]
Calendar age point estimates for depths based on weighted average of all age-depth curves [est=1]
Calendar scale used: cal BP [BCAD=FALSE] at a resolution of 1 yr [yrsteps]
Ages were calculated every 1 [every] cm [depth], from 28 [dmin] to 643 [dmax] cm

A slump was excised between 374 and 348 cm 

Goodness-of-fit (-log, lower is better):  3.91 
Any models with age-depth reversals were removed
