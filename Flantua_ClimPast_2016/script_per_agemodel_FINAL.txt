# Run 8 Estimated top age not included. Future ages at top. 
# Run 9 Estimated top age included. Surface=recent. Smoothness at default 0.3. Future ages at top.
# Run 10 Smoothness adjusted to 0.15 to improve fit and avoid future ages at top.

# Run 8 Outliers used as defined by authors. Age reversal at 300cm. Smoothness at default 0.3.
# Run 9 Smoothness more rigid to remove reversal. Adjusted to 0.6
